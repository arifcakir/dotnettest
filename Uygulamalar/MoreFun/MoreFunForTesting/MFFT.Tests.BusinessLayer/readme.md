NSubstitute will only work properly with interfaces, or with class members that are overridable from the test assembly. Be very careful substituting for classes with non-virtual or internal virtual members, as real code could be inadvertently executed in your test. See Creating a substitute and How NSubstitute works for more information. Also make sure to install NSubstitute.Analyzers which can warn about many of these cases (but not all of them; be careful with classes!).
